## üìñ Introduction

3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of completion results. To address this, we propose **D**isentangling **I**nstance and **S**cene **C**ontexts (**DISC**), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization. Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55, respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by **17.9%** and **11.9%**, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test.

(b) The Discriminative Query Generator (DQI) integrates geometric and contextual priors into instance and scene queries based on category attributes. (c) Details of the Adaptive Instance Layer (AIL) and the Global Scene Layer (GSL), which address the distinct challenges faced by instance and scene categories during the reconstruction process in a differentiated manner. For clarity, the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) and positional embedding are omitted in the figure.
